Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.
Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.
You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.
Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.







public class Solution {
    public int possibleStringCount(String word) {
        int n = word.length();
        int count = 1;
        char pre = word.charAt(0);
        int temp = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            char ch = word.charAt(i);
            if (ch == pre) {
                temp++;
            } else {
                if (temp >= 1) {
                    count += temp;
                }
                temp = 0;
                pre = ch;
            }
        }
        if (temp >= 1) {
            count += temp;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
