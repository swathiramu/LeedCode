Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.





class Solution {
    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        int decimal = 0;
        ListNode current = head;
        
        while (current != null) {
            decimal = decimal * 2 + current.val;
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return decimal;
    }
}
